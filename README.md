## About

Currently, there are many student associations in the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez that have different activities every day. Nowadays, the most common way to learn about these activities is by either checking your emails sent by “el cartero” to see if you have received information about the activity or by checking the Facebook page of each corresponding association. This method is not efficient because students receive multiple emails every day and will probably skip over the emails announcing the associations’ activities. The other alternative is by checking Facebook for information about the event but you need to know the association’s name. Our product aims to ease these problems and help the student body by creating a web app that will consolidate and facilitate all of the associations’ announcements of their events and let the students track and discover events that they find attractive all in one place.
